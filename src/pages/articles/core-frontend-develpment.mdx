If I`m truly being honest, I did not enjoy programming the first time I took it in college. Programming in C and looking at the console was not the most interesting thing that happened to me. However, I was motivated to do one thing, to create my own website.

I watched tons of youtube video tutorials and started many projects, unfortunately embarrassing they might be, I did learn how to create a website from simple slicing psd files to Dreamweaver and finally to my first HTML and CSS.

Fastforward to 2022, I was given the opportunity to take the professional certification from Meta for frontend development. I think this is a good chance for me to refresh my knowledge on frontend fundamentals and learn advanced react which is yet to be released.

I am amazed by how much I learned on the topics I thought I already knew. It's never too late to keep learning.
