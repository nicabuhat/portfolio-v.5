The first time I heard the term "user experience" was in college. It was a subject I thought would be easy because I have a background in design. Little did I know that design is just the surface level of the whole user experience.

Six years later after college, I found a professional certification offered by Google in Coursera which I thought would be a good addition to my arsenal of skills. I must admit that I thought it would be an easy class because of my background. Each course from the certification is thorough and makes you realize the mentality behind each decision made in the design process.

I realized that some times, I was being biased to my designs by my own taste and preference which the clients did not question due to my "authority in the matter". I'm at course 3 out of 7 and the silver lining that I saw is that innovation doesn't happen by chance but by well crafted design.
